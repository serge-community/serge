CONTRIBUTING

Your contributions to the project mean a lot to us. Bugfixes are accepted
in the form of pull requests (one per bug). Before filing a bug, please
make sure it still appears in the bleeding edge version published on GitHub.
CPAN versions may lag behind the code on GitHub.

DISCUSSING BUGS / FEATURES

We encourage you to file issues to discuss bugs and enhancements
prior to making a pull request. This will make sure that your changes
are something we want to see in the mainstream version and understand
what they are about.
